# ZBook
This is an electronic booking system for tech (cameras, lenses, microphones, etc)

This program is not intended for commercial use, it is only intended to showcase some of my programming skills. As of right now, there is no associated .jar file, because the point of the program is not its use but rather the coding that went into it.

feel free to download all of the files in the repository and open in an IDE of your choosing.

There is a database file (master.db) that is included within all of the .java files. If you do not have this file, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE PROGRAM. There is a table of permitted users contained within the database that cannot be bypassed (without substantial editing to the source code, which is not recommended).

login credantials that can be used are as follows
Username: admin
Password: password

from here, you can look at some of the fetures of the program.

any questions can be emailed to me at zachary.j.cohan@gmail.com and I will get to them when I can. Thank you
